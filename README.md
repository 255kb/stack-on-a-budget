# Stack on a budget

This repository offers a collection of services with free tiers for developers on a budget. Because not everyone has 20$ per month to spend on apps or database hosting for every single side-project.

Nowadays, a lot of services are offering really good free tier more than enough for testing and small apps in production. They are just waiting to be used by you.
