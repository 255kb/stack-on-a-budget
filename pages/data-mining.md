## Count

* *Free tier*: Single user, single database connection
* *Pros*: Connects to your database (BigQuery, PostgreSQL, others coming soon). Analysis is performed in a notebook interface, either by writing SQL or using drag-and-drop. Notebooks are rich documents containing analysis, media, and interactive elements.
* *Limitations*: Cannot share notebooks publically in free tier, and can only connect to one database.

## Metabase
