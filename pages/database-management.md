## KS DB Merge Tools

[Product page](https://ksdbmerge.tools)

* *Free tier*: GUI for Windows - basic database diff and merge tasks; schema - primary object types (in most cases it is tables, views, stored procedures and functions), data - per table comparison and syncronization. Command line - free to use on Linux (see Limitations).
* *Pros*: Simple GUI to observe the primary database schema changes, easy way to get changed rows and counts for particular table. Command line on Linux allows to get some reports and sync scripts which are available only in the paid Standard version.
* *Limitations*: GUI - Standard features are not available (schema - more object types, data - views, custom queries, batch data diff, etc.). Command line - license does not allow automated use of the free Linux version by companies and organizations
* *Exceeding the free tier*: Not possible for GUI. Command line usage is not tracked and no actions are made in case if automated usage statement is violated.
* *Credit card required:* no
