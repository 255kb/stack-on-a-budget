## Let's encrypt

[Home page](https://letsencrypt.org/)

* *Free tier*: provide SSL certificates for free
* *Pros*: free?
* *Limitations*: certificates are valid for 90 days so automation is strongly recommended, no wildcard certificates

## Codeanywhere

[Home page](https://codeanywhere.com)
[Editor Features page](https://codeanywhere.com/features/editor)
[Pricing page](https://codeanywhere.com/pricing)

* *Free tier*: Web-based IDE
* *Pros*: Free forever; Usable wherever you have an internet connection; You can edit code, 'Google Docs style';
* *Cons*: Limited amount of connections: 1 connection per connection type;
* *Beyond free tier*: If you attempt to create more than 1 github connection, for example, it will block it and suggest you pay for Codeanywhere.
